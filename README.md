# Age Of Chaos

(c) Joel Longanecker 2019

A single player dungeon crawler written in c/c++/lua for MS Dos.

## Some history

I grew up in the 90's, and was gaming on PC before Windows 95 was even a thing. I had fond memories of playing games like sim city, tank wars, and whatever shareware I could get my hands on. My life changed forever when I discovered a little program called `qbasic.exe`. It was a text editor that yelled at me. I soon discovered the joy that was programming, and it's lead me down a very rewarding personal and career path.

Age of Chaos is a loveletter to my childhood. Taking mechanics from modern games, and modern tools, such as gcc and lua, and tools like map editors, vs code, among others, I intend to make a game that I want to play.

## Pace of development

I don't know how long it's going to make this game, I don't know exactly what it's going to look like right now. So far it's just been small demos showing off features of the engine.

<h3>1.2 Installing RHIDE</h3>

<p>There are two archives

<dl>
<dt><code>rhide??b.zip</code>
<dd>This contains the executables and the documentation for RHIDE
running on DJGPP

<br><dt><code>rhide-?.?-1.i386.rpm</code>
<dd>This is a RPM package with the statically linked binaries of RHIDE
for GNU/Linux.

<br><dt><code>rhide??s.zip</code>
<dd>This contains the sources of RHIDE for DJGPP.

<br><dt><code>rhide-?.?-1.src.rpm</code>
<dd>This is a RPM package with the sources of RHIDE for GNU/Linux.

</dl>

<p>NOTE: The sources for the GNU/Linux and DJGPP versions are of course
in its core the same, there are only differences in the directory
structure and maybe in some preconfigured files. But in general
both archives can be used on both systems (after some cosmetic changes).

<p>where <code>??</code> in the above filenames stand for the digits of the actual
version of RHIDE which is as of writing this version 1.5 which leads to
<code>15</code>.

<p>These archives can be found at
<br>
<a href="http://www.rhide.com">The RHIDE home page</a>
<br>
or at any ftp site, which mirrors DJGPP. On that DJGPP mirrors are of
course only the DJGPP archives available.

<p>RHIDE is now also hosted on sourceforge, from where you can
download also the latest versions. 
<br>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rhide">RHIDE on sourceforge</a>

<p>The RPM packackes can be found at sunsite mirrors and/or also
in some GNU/Linux distributions. (At least I hope so when I`m ready
to upload them there)

<p>To install these archives, unzip them in the DJGPP-root
directory, like any other DJGPP package.

<p>To install the GNU/Linux RPM packages, use your favorite install
program (most Linux distributions allow to install RPM packages)
or install it with the Redhat package manager itself.

<h3>1.3 What is RHIDE?</h3>

<p>What is RHIDE? RHIDE is an Integrated Development Environment for
compiling C- or C++-files (GNU-Assembler source files also supported)
in an environment, which has an integrated editor where you can edit your
source files and a project management, where you can define, which
files are needed to build a program or a library.

<p>For what stands the name RHIDE? This has nothing mystic in it. It comes
simply from my initials RH and IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

<p>RHIDE works like the IDE from Borland, which comes with Turbo C++ 3.1 and
is written with the Turbo Vision library, which I have ported to use with
DJGPP. Features of this IDE are:
<ul>

<li>Syntax highlighting is now supported and you can customize all
colors on your desktop.

<li>You can redirect the stdout and stderr from your program to
a window in the IDE.

<li>You can generate a makefile for your project, so you can build
the program also without the IDE.

<li>Most of the commandline options of GCC can be customized.

<li>You can also build a library instead of an executable.

<li>When saving a file to disk, the modification time of this file
will be set to the time of the last modification in the editor.

<li>You can interrupt external programs (the compilers or your
program) by pressing &lt;Ctrl+C&gt;
 or
&lt;Ctrl+Break&gt;
 which are
ignored by the IDE. That means also, that you cannot interrupt the
IDE by pressing these keys. If you want to enable this, compile
the IDE without the <code>-DNO_BREAK</code>-flag.

<li>The integrated debugger. You can debug your program within RHIDE by
executing each source line of your code and evaluating/modifying variables
and expressions.

<li>You can define another compiler to compile your source files.

</ul>

<p>In addition to RHIDE I have included a stand-alone debugger
(called <code>rhgdb.exe</code>), which is GDB 5.0 with a Turbo Vision user
interface.

<h3>1.4 Requirements</h3>

<p>RHIDE works under and is compiled with DJGPP V2. 
To compile your programs you need
a working GCC-configuration, that means, GCC must be found in your
path. Because DJGPP works only under DPMI you need a DPMI-Server. 
If you run it under Windows 3.1(1)/95, you have DPMI. Under MS-DOS you
need either a memory-manager, which give you DPMI-services (I think QEMM is
it, EMM386 has no DPMI-support), or you use CWSDPMI, the free DPMI-server
from Charles W. Sandmann, which you can find on SimTel-ftp-sites. I use it
and it works fine for me.

<p>Running RHIDE under Windows NT or Windows 2000 is very limited since of
the poor support there for DOS programs.

<p>The builtin editor uses a simple heuristic to check, if a file
is in UNIX or DOS text format. It checks the first 1024 Bytes, and if
there is a lf without a cr, all lf's will be translated to cr/lf's. This
is done at first only in memory. But if you save your file to disk,
it will be saved in DOS text format.

<p>RHIDE will work correctly only with DJGPP version 2.03 or higher.

<br>

<h3>1.5 Getting started</h3>

<p>To run RHIDE type
<br><pre>rhide [options] ['file-name']
</pre>
or
<br><pre>rhide [options] 'project-name' [options]
</pre>
Here stands 'file-name', for a file, which you want to open at start up. 
If it has no suffix it is assumed to be a 'project-name'.

<p>'project-name' stands for a name of your project. If you don't type
it, RHIDE searches the current directory for a project file. If there exists
only one, it will be opened. If there exist more than one or none, RHIDE
will not open a project, you have to do it manually. 
see <a href="#Open%20project">Open project</a>.

<p>Possible options are
for debugging RHIDE itself see <a href="#Debugging%20RHIDE">Debugging RHIDE</a>. 
If no project was open, you will see an empty desktop. 
At the top-line of the screen you can see the menu. This is activated by
pressing &lt;F10&gt;
 or by clicking with the mouse at this line. 
Alternatively
you can press &lt;Alt&gt; plus the highlighted character of a pull-down
menu, <i>e.g.</i> to activate the <em>File</em> menu, press <kbd>Alt+F</kbd>. At the
bottom is the status line with some hotkeys and their functions displayed.

<p>Other options are:

<dl>
<dt><code>-H</code>
<dd>Do not install the console switch handler, which saves/restores
the modified keyboard layout. This options works only when running
under GNU/Linux.

<br><dt><code>-S</code>
<dd>Tells RHIDE to use only 16bit access to the video memory under
DJGPP, because some video cards cannot handle the 32bit access.

<br><dt><code>-E</code>
<dd>Dump all variables known to RHIDE (the builtins and the real environment
variables) to <code>stderr</code> end exit.

<br><dt><code>-C</code>
<dd>Disable the handling of SIGINT

<br><dt><code>-y</code>
<dd>Use long filenames (only under Windows 95)

<br><dt><code>-n</code>
<dd>Do not use long filenames (only under Windows 95)

<br><dt><code>-c</code>
<dd>Do not convert the case of any file name

<br><dt><code>-h</code>
<dd>Show a short help about all the possible options.

<br><dt><code>-b</code>
<dd>Use BIOS calls for setting and resetting the behavior of the
7th bit in a color attribute (blinking or 16 background colors) instead of
direct outputs to the VGA registers.

<br><dt><code>-p</code>
<dd>Normally RHIDE converts all the num-pad keys to the equivalent keys on the
other keyboard (of course also by checking the &lt;NumLock&gt; key). With this
switch you can disable this.

<br><dt><code>-G n</code>
<dd>Select which method is used for swapping the display. Currently there
are two, little different functions implemented. 
If you have problems with display swapping when in graphics mode, try
to use another method and see if that helps.

<br><dt><code>-K</code>
<dd>Tell RHIDE, to use real BIOS calls for it's keyboard input. This is
needed sometimes, when you have installed some special keyboard
drivers.

<br><dt><code>-M</code>
<dd>This tells RHIDE to not to install the mouse callback function for
getting the mouse events. Instead of this RHIDE calls the mouse
BIOS functions for getting any event of the mouse. This option should
be used mainly when running under Windows NT (but there I select this
now automatically by default)

</dl>

<p>At the upper right corner of the screen you can see the free virtual/physical
memory (where M stands for Megabytes, K for Kilobytes and B for Bytes), if
enabled see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a>.

<p>If you try to open a project, which does not exist, RHIDE will create a
new one. For the default setting in the newly created project, RHIDE
will look first in some directories if there exists an options file
for RHIDE called <code>rh_opt.gpr</code>. If this file is found, the options
from that file are used for the new project, otherwise the in RHIDE
hardcoded defaults are used.

<h4>1.5.1 Supported languages</h4>

<p>There is also support for multiple languages. For this RHIDE uses the
GNU gettext library. With this lib it is possible to support multiple
languages without changing any code of RHIDE, when adding a new language.

<p>There are two ways for selecting the language. Either you set the environment
variable <var>LANGUAGE</var> to the language you want or give it as a commandline
argument to RHIDE. The normal way is by setting <var>LANGUAGE</var>. If you
have installed RHIDE as described in the <code>readme</code>, you should
specify the language with a two character shortcut. Because of my limited
time, the translations to are not synronized with RHIDE.

<p>When you want to specify the language on the commandline, use the following
syntax:
<br><pre>rhide -L LANGUAGE
</pre>
where LANGUAGE represents the language code.

<p>If you do not specify any language, English is assumed.

<p>Because it was not possible to get all the translations at the time
when RHIDE was ready, I included only the
message files (that are the files with the <code>.mo</code> suffix) as they
are ready in the binary archive. That means that it is possible that
you will see some strings
in English instead of your language.

<h4>1.5.2 Debugging RHIDE</h4>

<p>I have added some commandline options to debug the IDE itself. These options
are the following:

<dl>

<br><dt><code>-dt</code>
<dd>Do not remove the temporary files which the IDE creates. The
names of these files will be printed to stderr.

<br><dt><code>-dc</code>
<dd>Print to <code>stderr</code> the commands which the IDE executes.

<br><dt><code>-dd</code>
<dd>Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE checks the dependencies.

<br><dt><code>-df</code>
<dd>Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE searches for files.

<br><dt><code>-ds</code>
<dd>Print to <code>stderr</code> how the IDE expands the specs.

<br><dt><code>-da</code>
<dd>Turns on all of the above

</dl>

<p>You can also combine these options like <code>-dct</code>, which is the same as
<code>-dc -dt</code>.

<p>To examine this debugging information, it is the best to use the redir
command, to redirect the stderr to a file like
<br><pre>redir -e err rhide -da project
</pre>
which will redirect stderr to the file <code>err</code>.

<p>Under GNU/Linux use the following command:
<br><pre>rhide -da project 2&gt;err
</pre>

<p>Each of the letters above (after <code>-d</code>) can be prefixed by
a <code>-</code> or a <code>+</code> to explicitely turn the flag on or off. 
For instance <code>-dc</code> and <code>-d+c</code> are the same and
<code>-da-c</code> selects all debugging options except the <code>-dc</code>
switch.

<p>If you want to supply certain switches for RHIDE as a default,
you may put them into the environment variable <code>$(RHIDEOPT)</code>. 
The contents of
this variable is used before the the real commandline is parsed. 
That means you can overwrite the switches from the environment variable.

<h3>1.6 The program GPR2MAK</h3>

<p>This program can be used to create a makefile from your project-file. 
It does exactly the same as the function which is selectable from
the RHIDE menu see <a href="#Write%20Makefile">Write Makefile</a>.

<p>In RHIDE you have only the possibility to say, if in the generated
makefile all dependencies should be included or not. With
<code>gpr2mak</code> you can tell also to create recursively all the
needed makefiles. This makes sense only if you have included other
projects in your project.

<p>Here are the possible commandline options for <code>gpr2mak</code>.
<dl>
<dt><code>-d</code>
<dd>Include all dependencies in the makefile

<br><dt><code>-d-</code>
<dd>Include only the needed dependencies to create the final program or
library.

<br><dt><code>-r</code>
<dd>Call <code>gpr2mak</code> recursively, if there are other projects part
of the project.

<br><dt><code>-r-</code>
<dd>Do not call <code>gpr2mak</code> recursively.

<br><dt><code>-o OUTFILE</code>
<dd>Use <code>OUTFILE</code> instead of the project name (with the suffix <code>.mak</code>)
as the created makefile. If you want to write the makefile to <code>stdout</code>,
use <code>-</code> as <code>OUTFILE</code>.

</dl>

<p>And the complete syntax for calling <code>gpr2mak</code> is also:

<br><pre>gpr2mak [-d[-]] [-r[-]] [-o OUTFILE] project-file
</pre>

<p>If you give no options, (the project-file must be given), <code>gpr2mak</code>
assumes the flags <code>-d- -r-</code> as default.

<h3>1.7 The program GPREXP</h3>

<p>The main reason for this program was the need for me to have
project files which should work on different computers and also
on different systems (like DJGPP and GNU/Linux). The task for this
program is to convert as most as possible absolute filenames stored
in the project file to use variables so the project can be used by
simply changing some variables outside RHIDE.

<p>GPREXP replaces all directories, which are used also in the dialogs
like the directory customizations for include file searches, by the
variables if they are known there.

<h4>1.8.1 What are these so called projects</h4>

<p>A project for RHIDE is a file, which contains all the needed information
required to build a program or library from
one or more source files. Also all the other options which belong
to the look and feel of your desktop are stored there.

<p>In general RHIDE creates for each project two files. One for the project
itself (it has the suffix <code>.gpr</code>) and one for the desktop related
things (it has the suffix <code>.gdt</code>).

<p>To create a new project either run rhide with a not existing project
name as argument or open within RHIDE a project by selecting a name
which is not existent.

<br>

<h4>1.8.2 Creating your first project</h4>

<p>For the next instructions I will assume, that you want to create a project
for the standard "Hello world" program in the current directory. Create now
the new project by running

<br><pre>rhide hello
</pre>

<p>and you will see an empty desktop and one window opened, the project window. 
This window will show you that there is no file defined for your project. 
If the project window is selected, (it has a double frame), then hit there
&lt;Ins&gt; and you will be prompted for adding an item to your project.

<p>Type in the input line now <code>hello.c</code> and hit &lt;ENTER&gt;. Now hit
&lt;ESC&gt; to leave the dialog. You will see now, that the project window
contains a line with <code>hello.c</code>.

<p>Now hit &lt;ENTER&gt; on that filename and you will get an empty editor window
named <code>hello.c</code> prepended by the current directory. In this editor
window you can type now the program:

<br><pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  printf("Hello world!\n");
  exit(0);
}

</pre>

<p>Now you can select from the Run-menu the Run entry (or use the
hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+F9</kbd>) and RHIDE will do all the necessary steps
to compile, link and execute the program.

<p>If everything was correct (no typing errors) or some other error,
you will get a message box where RHIDE tells you, that the program
exited with an exit code of 0. (This is the value, which you have
specified in your program above in the <code>exit(0);</code> statement)
This box you can close with &lt;ENTER&gt; or &lt;ESC&gt;.

<p>To see the output of the program, you can switch now to the user
screen with <kbd>Alt+F5</kbd> or from the menu (Windows/User screen). 
To return back to RHIDE hit any key.

<h3>1.9 Environment variables</h3>

<p>RHIDE uses many environment variables for it's configuration
and behavior. This includes also some standard variables, which
are used by the in RHIDE linked libraries. These are:

<dl>
<dt>$(LOCALEDIR)
<dd>This should point to the directory, where your locale files are
stored. If it is not set, RHIDE tries to get the system default
value, which is for GNU/Linux <code>/usr/share/locale</code> and for
DJGPP <code>$(DJDIR)/share/locale</code>.

<br><dt>$(INFOPATH)
<dd>This is a pathlist of directories, where your INFO files are
stored. If not set, RHIDE tries the standard directory, which
should for GNU/Linux <code>/usr/info</code> and for DJGPP <code>$(DJDIR)/info</code>.

<br><dt>$(RHIDEOPT)
<dd>This variable can be used, to define global RHIDE commandline
options. The value of this variable is used, as if the contents
are given on commandline before any of the real commandline
options. Which means, they can be overwritten on the commandline.

<br><dt>$(ESCDELAY)
<dd>This variable is used <em>ONLY</em> in the GNU/Linux version, where it
defines the delay after pressing &lt;ESC&gt; to wait for another
keypress to simulate an &lt;Alt&gt; keycode. The value is given in
milliseconds and defaults to 1000.

<br><dt>$(LANGUAGE)
<dd>This variable is used to specify the language, in which RHIDE should
communicate with you. The contents of this variable should be the
ISO 2-character code of your country.

<br><dt>$(RHIDE_SHARE)
<dd>With this variable you can tell RHIDE where it should look
at first for it's configuration files.

<h4>1.9.1 Setting environment variables for RHIDE</h4>

<p>There are some different ways for setting environment variables
for RHIDE. One of them is to set them like
any other environment variable on your system. But this
means that these variables are visible also by all the
other programs.

<p>When using the DJGPP version, you can set them in your
<code>djgpp.env</code> file either at the beginning as global variables
for any DJGPP program or in a special section <code>[RHIDE]</code> only
for RHIDE. Please read the doc about the format of the <code>djgpp.env</code>
file for more information.

<p>Derived from the technique used on DJGPP for setting environment
variables which are visible only for DJGPP programs, I have added
in RHIDE a similar thing. RHIDE can read environment variables also
from a file called <code>rhide.env</code>.

<p>The syntax of this file is very simple. Each line has one of the
following syntax:
<dl>
<dt>VARIABLE=CONTENTS
<dd>Which means, that the environment variable <code>VARIABLE</code> should
become the contents <code>CONTENTS</code> where <code>CONTENTS</code> can be also
a variable, which is expanded at runtime.

<br><dt>include OTHER_ENV_FILE
<dd>Such a line tells RHIDE to read in at that point
the file <code>OTHER_ENV_FILE</code> as environment file. The name
<code>OTHER_ENV_FILE</code> can be also an environment variable, which is
expanded before reading the file.

<p>The word <code>include</code> may optionally also start with a dash
<code>-</code>, to be compatible with GNU make.

<br><dt># comments
<dd>A line, which begins with a <code>#</code> means, that this line is ignored. 
It can be used for you to write there some comments about that file.

<br><dt>export VARIABLE=CONTENTS
<dd>This is the same syntax as without the <code>export</code> at the beginning of the
line but it tells RHIDE to place the variable also in the environmen
so also other programs (called by RHIDE) can see this variable.

</dl>

<p>RHIDE is very powerful in handling the environment variables. Most
of it is taken from the behavior of GNU make. On this great things
depend, that a variable name can consist also of other variables, which are
computed when the variable should be expanded.

<p>In general, you can use the <code>rhide.env</code> files very similar
to makefiles for GNU make if you think there only about the
variables and functions from GNU make.

<p>As an example of this, you can take a look on the RHIDE sources in the
<code>rhide.env</code> files. There I'm using, for instance, the RHIDE
builtin variable $(RHIDE_OS) to define the libraries, which are linked
in RHIDE depending on the operating system where RHIDE is built.

<p>An other example is distributed with RHIDE in it's binary archives
as <code>rhide_.env</code> which is commented and should be in a directory
<code>.../share/rhide/</code> where the <code>...</code> stand for a different
directory on different OS's. (on DJGPP it is %DJDIR% and on GNU/Linux it
is /usr/local )

<p>Here is a part of the environment file <code>rhide.var</code> in the main
RHIDE source directory (which is included by <code>rhide.env</code> with
<br><pre>include $(RHIDESRC)/rhide.var
</pre>

<br><pre>RHIDE_OS_LIBS_Linux=ncurses gpm m
RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe=dbg
RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP=$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET))
RHIDE_OS_LIBS=$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))
</pre>

<p>The RHIDE builtin linker spec see <a href="#Builtin%20compiler%20specs">Builtin compiler specs</a>
includes also $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS) when linking. Since RHIDE
can be built on DJGPP and GNU/Linux and on these different operating
systems I have to link different libraries.

<p>Description of the above: When linking on DJGPP the file
<code>idegc.exe</code> (which is RHIDE) I have to include (in addition
to all the other libraries) <code>libdbg.a</code>, which contains all
the DJGPP specific debugging functions. This is done at runtime
by expanding RHIDE_OS_LIBS. Here are the steps, how RHIDE expands
the variable RHIDE_OS_LIBS:

<br><pre>$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS)                      -&gt;  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_$(RHIDE_OS))          -&gt;  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP)
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP)                -&gt;  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET))
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_$(MAIN_TARGET)) -&gt;  $(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe)
$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS_DJGPP_idegc.exe       -&gt;  dbg
</pre>

<p>In a similar way it expands on GNU/Linux to

<br><pre>$(RHIDE_OS_LIBS) -&gt; ncurses gpm m
</pre>

<h4>1.9.2 Where to store the environment file</h4>

<p>RHIDE searches some known directories for the file
<code>rhide.env</code> (and of course also other there defined
included files).

<p>At first it searches for a global file in <code>/usr/local/share/rhide</code>
(on GNU/Linux) or <code>$(DJDIR)/share/rhide</code>. Then it searches in
<code>$(HOME)</code> and at last in the current directory.

<p>RHIDE does not only a search, it also loads the file, if it was found
in any of the above mentioned directories. That means, if in all these
directories <code>rhide.env</code> exists, it is loaded. This has the effect,
that you can define some global defaults which can be overwritten with
a <code>rhide.env</code> in the current or your home directory.

<h2>2 General information about how RHIDE works</h2>

<p>In this section I will give you some comments about the concept of RHIDE. 
RHIDE works with the GNU compilers. As a result of this, most of the
options are fixed and they are mostly also specific only for this
compiler. If I speak about compilers, I mean GCC, which calls the right
compilers for you. 
(<code>cpp</code> for preprocessing your input files,
<code>cc1</code> for compiling C programs, <code>cc1plus</code> for
compiling C++ programs and <code>as</code> for compiling assembler files and so on)

<p>Selecting the right compiler for a specific file is done by RHIDE in the
same way as GCC does it. It looks for the extension of the file
and determines the language of this file.

<h3>2.1 Known suffixes</h3>

<p>The list of the known suffixes is taken from GCC. Remember the fact, that
GCC and RHIDE check the suffixes in a case sensitive way especially when
running under Windows 95 see <a href="#Running%20under%20Windows%2095">Running under Windows 95</a>.

<ul>

<li>Valid suffixes for C source files are
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.c</code>
<dd>Normal C source file

<br><dt><code>.i</code>
<dd>C source file, which doesn't need the preprocessor

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for C++ source files are
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.cc</code>
<dt><code>.cpp</code>
<dt><code>.cxx</code>
<dt><code>.C</code>
<dd>Normal C++ source file

<br><dt><code>.ii</code>
<dd>C++ source file, which doesn't need the preprocessor

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for Objective C source files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.m</code>
<dd>Normal Objective C source file

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for Pascal source files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.p</code>
<dt><code>.pas</code>
<dd>Normal Pascal source file

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for object files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.o</code>
<dd>Normal object file

<br><dt><code></code>
<dd>any other suffix,
which has no predefined meaning

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for libraries
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.a</code>
<dd>Normal library file

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for executable files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.exe</code>
<dd>Normal executable file for MS-DOS

<br><dt><code>.</code>
<dd>No suffix means the raw COFF image of an executable file. These
can be handled only by programs, which know about this format. 
(DJGPP programs know this)

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for include files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.h</code>
<dd>Normal include files

<br><dt><code>.hpp</code>
<dd>Some people told me, that this suffix should also be treated
as a valid suffix for header files, so I applied it.

<br><dt><code></code>
<dd>Theoretically there is no restriction for such a suffix, but
RHIDE searches and finds only files with the above suffixes
in the specified directories see <a href="#Include%20directories">Include directories</a>.

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for Assembler source files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.s</code>
<dd>Normal Assembler source file

<br><dt><code>.S</code>
<dd>Assembler source file, which must be preprocessed
by <code>cpp</code>. If you have such files, there is a problem, when
long filenames are not enabled (default in MS-DOS), because
RHIDE converts all filenames in this situation to lower case. But you
can add to the local options for this item see <a href="#Local%20options">Local options</a>
the commandline argument <var>-x assembler-with-cpp</var>, to tell
<code>GCC</code> to preprocess this file first before assembling it.

</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for Fortran source files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.f</code>
<dt><code>.for</code>
<dd>Normal Fortran source files

<br><dt><code>.F</code>
<dt><code>.fpp</code>
<dd>Fortran source files which need not to be run through <code>cpp</code>. 
</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for ADA source files
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.adb</code>
<dd>Normal ADA source file

<br><dt><code>.ads</code>
<dd>ADA specs file
</dl>

<li>Valid suffixes for NASM
<dl>

<br><dt><code>.nsm</code>
<br><dt><code>.asm</code>
<dd>Normal NASM source files. 
</dl>

</ul>

<h3>2.2 Syntax of arguments</h3>

<p>In RHIDE you can specify some arguments to other programs. These arguments
must be a space separated list of strings. If you want to have one or
more spaces as part of an argument, you have to enclose the whole argument
in single or double quotes.

<h3>2.3 Running under Windows 95</h3>

<p>With DJGPP 2.01 were many bugs fixed, which caused problems under
Windows 95 with the long (and case sensitive) filenames. Now all filenames
are shown in lower case, except they contain characters
with different case. That means, all normal 8+3 DOS filenames, which
are normally reported in Windows 95 in upper cases, are automatically
converted to lower case. For more information about filename
conversion look at the libc reference.

<p>If you really need the filenames exactly as they are reported by the
OS, you can use the <var>-c</var> switch see <a href="#Getting%20started">Getting started</a>.

<p>You can also run more than one instance of RHIDE at once, in several DOS-boxes,
because RHIDE creates and uses its own temp directory every time it starts to
disable conflicts, when running multiple compilers at the same time. This is
done by creating a directory in the directory pointed at by the environment
variables %TMPDIR%, %TEMP% or %TMP%, in that order, until one of them exists. If
none of them exists, the current directory is assumed. Then RHIDE puts the value
of this directory into the environment variable %TMPDIR%. After leaving RHIDE
this directory will be removed, if it is empty.

<br>

<h3>2.6 Running under GNU/Linux</h3>

<p>Since RHIDE is now available also for GNU/Linux here some hints. In general
you will get the best results when you have installed RHIDE as a setuid
root program. I know, this might be a security problem but I have tried
to make it as secure as possible. After getting acces to the screen and
the keyboard RHIDE will switch back to your normal rights and does not
use root rights any more. It does not write any data or modify any file
on disk with root rights (except you are running as root of course).

<p>The reason for this is the rudimentary support for fast access to the
screen and the totally hided acces to the keyboard in the Linux kernel. 
Additionally when you want to use the dual monitor debugging feature
of RHIDE this is also needed, because RHIDE needs in that case access
to the ports of your monochrome video card.

<p>Running RHIDE under X-Window is not full supported (but it is possible). 
There are several reasons for this. The first is, that RHIDE uses in that
case only terminal functions for input and output. That means it depends
completetly on your terminfo database and these are (at least for me)
in some cases totally wrong. You can see this mostly that RHIDE does not
handle correct the keyboard. Other programs which use ncurses know this also
and have there own hardcaded patches but I do not want to do so.

<p>To fix the keyboard conflicts when running in a xterm, I distribute
little modified terminfo file <code>/usr/local/share/rhide/xterm-rhide</code>
which you can place in <code>/usr/lib/terminfo/x</code> or when you have
no root access you can place it also in <code>$HOME/.terminfo/x</code>. 
And then to use this file simply set the environment variable to
this new terminal with
<br><pre>  export TERM=xterm-rhide
</pre>
before running RHIDE in the xterm.

<p>An other alternative is to run RHIDE in a rxvt terminal but there
you have to set also explicitely the TERM variable, because it
is set mostly to xterm-color.
<br><pre>  export TERM=rxvt
</pre>

<h4>2.7.1 Creating a program</h4>

<p>For creating a program, RHIDE allows you to define multiple source
files which should be compiled and linked to your final program. This
is done by creating a project. In this project you insert your source
files (and not all the include files).

<p>After a source file (which is inserted in your project) compiled at least
once, RHIDE knows about all dependencies of this file, so this file will
be compiled again only, if one of the include files have changed.

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Creating%20a%20program">Creating a program</a>
<br>

<h5>2.7.1.1 Creating a program without a project</h5>

<p>Because of many requests of users I made RHIDE to work also without
using a project. This may be good, if you have a single file, but if
your program should be build from more than one file I suggest you to
use a project.

<p>If you have only one editor window opened, the name of the resulting
program is taken from the name of the source file by removing the suffix
and on DJGPP appending <code>.exe</code>.

<p>If you have more than one files opened, I saw no other way for determining
the name of the produced program, than naming it <code>aout</code> (on DJGPP
<code>aout.exe</code>).

<br>

<h4>2.7.2 Creating a library</h4>

<p>You can also create libraries (a collection of object files,
which can be linked with other programs) with RHIDE. The way for doing this is
very simple. Because RHIDE knows about the meaning of file suffixes, you can
change the name of the main target see <a href="#Main%20targetname">Main targetname</a> to have a suffix
<code>.a</code> and that's all. Now RHIDE will run <code>ar</code> instead of linking.

<br>

<h4>2.7.3 Saving/Loading the options</h4>

<p>RHIDE supports two different ways for saving the options which you
have customized.

<p>The first one (which I prefer) is the use of the so called default
project. This is the project <code>rhide.gpr</code> and must be located
in the same directory where <code>rhide.exe</code> is. To create or modify
this default project change to that directory (normally %DJDIR%/bin)
and type there

<br><pre>rhide rhide
</pre>

<p>Now change any options you want and exit RHIDE. From now on these
options are used for any newly created project or when running
RHIDE without a project.

<p>The second way is to save your options to a project file
see <a href="#Save%20options">Save options</a> or to load them from any existing project
file see <a href="#Load%20options">Load options</a>.

<p>This brings up a dialog, where you can do some calculations. This
dialog is similar to the evaluate dialog see <a href="#Evaluate%2fModify">Evaluate/Modify</a>, but it
uses not the feature of GDB, but it is a separate calculator. 
For more information
see <a href="setedit.html#Calculator">Documentation for the editor</a>.

<p>There can be used also some of the standard functions like
<code>log</code>, <code>sin</code> and so on and it can convert also integer
values between different bases (<code>hex</code>, <code>oct</code>, <code>dec</code>).

window and the buttons for opening and canceling.

<p>In the filename input line you can type directly the file, which you want to
open or you can type any mask to list only some files. The default
mask is <code>*.cc</code>, but you can change this to anything and your last
typed mask is stored as the default mask for the next use. There is also
a history of your previous typed inputs available. This is selected when
you hit the down key or click at the small symbol at the end of the input line
with your mouse.

<p>The list of filenames shows all the files that correspond to the mask. 
If this list is selected you can choose a file with the cursor keys, or
you can type the first letters of the filename you want, and the
bar is located at the first file, which has these letters as the first
characters. To open the file simply press &lt;ENTER&gt; or double click
with the mouse on it.

<p>Below the list of filenames there is a small window with information
about the selected file (complete path, size, modification time).

(like written with GNU Pascal or GNU Fortran), where the function
of your main program is not <code>main</code>.

are executed normally before <code>main</code> is called (for instance
the global constructors).

at the current execution point of your program.

<p>You can step see <a href="#Step%20over">Step over</a> or trace see <a href="#Trace%20into">Trace into</a> here in the same way
like in an editor window and you can also debug code, which has no
debugging information.

<p>Additionally you can scroll here also forwards or backwards but
scrolling backwards is very hard to implememnt and so you will get
when scrolling backwards most of the time wrong output. Sorry for
this, but until I find more time to implement this better you have to
live with it.

<p>This shows a window with a list of functions, from which the current

information, you will go to the source line which is shown in the

<h4>3.7.7 List of Functions</h4>

<p>This asks first for a regular expression to list only those functions
of your program, which match that expression. The syntax for such
a regular expression is a little bit different from the wildcards you are
probably knowing from MS-DOS.

<p>If you want to get a list of all functions you should enter either
nothing (the default), or ".*", or "?*" (both without the double quotes). 
The expression "*" does NOT mean all function. In fact, your entry will be
interpreted as a regular expression.

<p>After you have typed the expression and pressed &lt;Enter&gt;, you will get
a list of functions that match the regular expression and for
which debugging information is available.

<p>This list is sorted by the name of the function and has three parts:

<br><pre>NAME | RETURN VALUE | FILE
</pre>

<p>You can walk through the list with the cursor keys or the mouse. If you hit
&lt;Enter&gt; or double click a function, you will go the the source code
of that function.

<p>Here is the point to open a project. After selecting this menu
item, the file open dialog is opened to select a project. You can type
the name of the project or select one from the list.

<p>If you open a project in another directory than the current, RHIDE will
change the current directory to this directory and then the project
will be opened.

<p>If you type here a name of a project which does not exist, a new one
is created.

<p>If no project was opened
and you create a new project,
all open desktop files remain open, but they are not added to
the project. 
If a project was opened, it will be automatically closed before the
new project is opened.

within the project window.

<p>Currently it is impossible to use relative or absolute paths as part
of a project item. If you have your files in several directories, you
have to setup either the search path for source files or you have to create
for each directory a library that can be included in your project.

<h4>3.8.7 Main targetname</h4>

<p>Here you can change the name of your main target. The main target is either
an executable file or a library. RHIDE selects the type of the main target
from the suffix of this name. If it has no suffix or the suffix <code>.exe</code>,
an executable will be built. If it has the suffix <code>.a</code>, a library will
be created.

<p>Remember when you give it no suffix, both, the COFF image and the <code>.exe</code>
file will created. If it has the <code>.exe</code> suffix, only the <code>.exe</code>
file is created.

that your program is written in Pascal and does NOT check any dependencies
of the project, because this is done automatically by GPC with the
<code>--automake</code> option.

<p>If you don't want to use the 'automake' feature of GPC, even when building
a Pascal program, give here an empty name, which is the default.

<p>All the paths you can define in the several entries have the form
of a semicolon separated list of directories, just like your environment
variable %PATH%. You can use forward slashes and back slashes, but they
are all converted to forward slashes by RHIDE. You can also use
environment variables as part of your paths. The syntax of such a variable
is that of a GNU makefile. If you want to use the variable <code>%DJDIR%</code>,
you must type <code>$(DJDIR)</code>.

<h5>3.9.1.4 Sources directories</h5>

<p>This is the list of directories, where RHIDE looks for the source files
(after looking in the current directory).

<p>It enables you also
one feature (like I use it mostly at any time), to
have the sources in one directory tree and the objects
and executables in a total different directory. Simply
Go to any directory, create there your project and then
add the needed files to your project. Finally specify
the path to your sources here and RHIDE will find them.

<p>The options in the dialogs for Warnings, Debugging, C-flags and CXX-Flags
are selected with the cursor-keys or the mouse and are activated or
deactivated by pressing &lt;SPACE&gt;
or by double-clicking
with the mouse at the first field of the option. If an option can take an
additional value or string, an inputbox will be opened, and you can type them
there. If the additional value is optional, you can leave this input-box
by pressing &lt;ESC&gt;
or activating the <em>Cancel</em> button
and no value, or the previous one will be appended to this option.

<h4>3.9.3 Libraries</h4>

<p>Here you can tell the linker which libraries will be
linked in your program. At this time the number of additional libraries
is limited to 16. If you need more, you have to type them manually
see <a href="#Linker%20options">Linker options</a>

<p>In the input-fields of the dialog you only have to type the part of your
library name after <code>lib</code> and before <code>.a</code>. Example: If your library
is <code>libtv.a</code> put only <code>tv</code> there. You can switch
between the input lines for the libraries using &lt;Tab&gt;
or
&lt;Down Arrow&gt; (next field) or &lt;Shift+Tab&gt;
or
&lt;Up Arrow&gt; (previous field). If you have
typed your libraries you can activate or disable them by switching the
checkbox before the name on or off. This is done by pressing &lt;Alt&gt; and
the corresponding digit or letter of the checkbox at the same time or by
clicking with the mouse.

<p>Normally RHIDE checks the types of your source-files and automatically
adds some standard libraries, corresponding to these source-files. 
These are for C++ files the library <code>libiostream.a</code>
and for Objective C files the <code>libobjc.a</code> library. 
If you want to disable this, deactivate the <em>Use standard libraries</em>
checkbox. This adds also the commandline option <var>-nostdlib</var> to
GCC,
that means, you must give the linker explicitly all of the standard
libraries, which you need. This includes the <code>libgcc.a</code> and
<code>libc.a</code> libraries.

<h5>create backup files</h5>

<p>Create backup files when saving. When it is enabled, RHIDE creates a backup
of the file to save under the same name as the editing file, but the suffix
is replaced with <code>.bak</code>

<h5>syntax highlighting</h5>

<p>Turn the Syntax highlight on or off. RHIDE automatically checks the suffix
of the editing file to determine the correct syntax highlighting. 
Currently this is supported only for C, C++, and Pascal source files. 
All other files are not specially highlighted.

<h5>Use dual display</h5>

<p>Here is an very powerful option. If you have installed on your computer
a secondary display (monochrome monitor) in addition to your VGA monitor,
RHIDE can (when this option is enabled) switch to the second monitor
for it's output and you can see your program on the normal monitor.

<p>If this option is enabled and you have not a secondary monitor installed,
RHIDE will detect this and does not switch to it.

<h5>No file caching</h5>

<p>If this option is enabled, RHIDE does not use
the internal caching of information about searching files and
modification times. Use this only if you have problems with the
automatic checking of dependencies, because this slows down RHIDE.

<h5>16 background colors</h5>

<p>On EGA/VGA video cards it is possible to use 16 background colors instead
of normal 8. This is done by telling the video card how to interpret
the highest bit of the color attribute. If you enable this, you can use
up to 16 background colors, otherwise there are only 8 colors for the
background available. To get blinking foreground colors, you must use a
little trick. Enable at first this option here. Then change the color
attribute to highlight background color you want and then
reset the '16 background colors' option.

<h5>Screen mode</h5>

mode and type the value of this mode (see in the reference of
your video card) as a decimal or hexadecimal (preceeded by
<code>0x</code>) number. But
you can use only textmodes (modes with starting video ram address
at <code>0xB800:0000</code>. For the numbers of the videomodes refer to
the documentation of your video card. 
If you type an invalid videomode (RHIDE checks it), the
80x25-Mode will automatically selected.

<p>I have tested all available text modes with my
et4000-card, and they work. For some modes, (mostly every
high resolution text mode)
the mouse cursor is shown by my own routine. 
That means that you can use the mouse also in the high resolution text
modes.

<h5>How to change the list of flags</h5>

<p>The syntax of the strings, which you can modify or add with the last
menu-entries is any string followed by an optional modifier with
the following meaning:

<dl>
<dt><code>%d</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>must</em> enter
an integer there

<br><dt><code>%d?</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>can</em> enter
an integer there

<br><dt><code>%c</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>must</em> enter
a character there

<br><dt><code>%c?</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>can</em> enter
a character there

<br><dt><code>%s</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>must</em> enter
a string there

<br><dt><code>%s?</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>can</em> enter
a string there

<br><dt><code>%s(STRING)</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>must</em>
enter a string, which contains only characters defined by
the string STRING, there

<br><dt><code>%s?(STRING)</code>
<dd>if you activate this option, you <em>can</em>
enter a string, which contains only characters defined by
the string STRING, there

</dl>

<p>As an example: the string for the <code>-O</code> option is defined as
<code>-O%d?</code> and the <code>-d</code> option see <a href="#Debugging">Debugging</a> is
defined as
<br> <code>-d%s(MNDyrxjsLtfcSlgRJdkamp)</code><br>
which means, the
string after <code>-d</code> must be a combination of the characters in
<br> <code>MNDyrxjsLtfcSlgRJdkamp</code><br>

<p>If you leave the dialogs for modifying the flag lists with the
<em>OK</em> button or if you activate the <em>Default</em> button, all
flags are disabled

<h4>3.11.1 Help</h4>

<p>This opens the INFO viewer. Many thanks at this point to
Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET). He wrote the very good INFO viewer for
use with RHIDE. This was also the most important reason for me to
write the documentation in Texinfo, because you have now an online help
available with the produced
INFO file <code>rhide.info</code>.

<p>Pressing &lt;F1&gt;
invokes the help system from everywhere. 
For help on using the INFO viewer, press
&lt;F1&gt;
within the help window. 
But the above things work only if you have correctly installed the INFO files
that come with RHIDE.

<p>If you have installed the binary archive of RHIDE as described in the
<code>readme.bin</code>, the INFO files are in <code>%DJDIR%/info</code>. If you
have not modified your <code>djgpp.env</code> file, this directory is searched
for the INFO files.

<p>But you can put the INFO files in any directory you want, if you add this
directory to the %INFOPATH% variable in your <code>djgpp.env</code> file in
the section for <code>info</code>.

<h3>4.1 Selecting a window</h3>

<p>To select a window you can do the following. If the window has a number,
this is right on the top-frame, you can select this window by pressing
&lt;Alt&gt;
and this number (but only if the number
is a single digit). 
Or you click anywhere in the window or on the
frame of the window with your mouse.

<h3>4.2 How the editor works</h3>

<p>This section should describe the work of the editor. But because the editor
is now so complex and, not my own work, there is now separate documentation
with more detailed and better description see
<a href="setedit.html#Top">Documentation for the editor</a>. 
But you
can read also more from my doc, which describes the most common (for me)
usage of the editor.

<p>Here I describe most of the editor commands. If there is a key command like
<kbd>Ctrl+Q+Y</kbd>, press &lt;Ctrl&gt; and &lt;Q&gt; simultaneously and
after this press &lt;Y&gt;.

<p>I strongly recommend not to use the technique by holding down the &lt;Ctrl&gt;
key when pressing the second key in such key combinations, because for
instance when you press <kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> and then <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> you will be
prompted if you want to interrupt RHIDE (because you pressed the interrupt
key). But if you really want to use this methode, you should use the
<code>-C</code> commandline switch when starting RHIDE to disable the handling
of <code>SIGINIT</code>.

<h3>4.3 Some hints and problems</h3>

<p>To compile only a single file, you don't need to include it in a project. 
You only have to open it and do a compile. If a file is in your project,
you can compile it, if you are in its editor-window or if you are in the
project-window and this file is selected.

<p>Warnings and errors from compiling a file are listed in the message-window. 
If there are warnings or errors, you can jump to the corresponding source by
hitting &lt;ENTER&gt;
on this message. If this file wasn't
already opened, it will be opened.

<br>

<h4>4.3.1 Problems with automatic dependencies</h4>

<p>Most checking of the dependencies works correctly, but there are some few
situations, where this checking gets confused. The first results in the fact
that I implemented a cache function for getting the modification time
of files, that means, most files are 'stat'ed only once, after starting
RHIDE. But if someone modifies one of the files, which are in the cache,
(this can be another program, when you run RHIDE in a multitasking
environment, such as Windows) or if you run your project and it modifies some
of these files, the internal cache is after this not up to date.

<p>Here is another situation. Your source files are not in the current
directory. You have opened a source file for editing and successfully
built your project. Now you leave RHIDE, because you want to debug your
program with <code>FSDB</code>, you copy the source file (in this case it is the
file, which you have opened in the IDE) to the current directory. Now
you debug it and there are some errors. You restart RHIDE to make the
changes in the file. The previously opened file will be opened automatically
and you edit it. If you do now a <em>Make</em>, RHIDE tells you, that your project
is up to date, because it searches for source files at first in the current
directory, and there is the unmodified file.

<p>In this chapter I will give you for some special parts a more detailed
description of what they do.

<h4>4.4.1 Items of your project</h4>

<p>The items in the project window, and therefore also in your project, are
sorted in alphabetical order. This has the effect of faster finding
an item and you can also move the selecting bar to a specified item by
typing the name of this item.

<p>Normally, the alphabetic order of the project items causes no problems because
the linker searches at first <em>every</em> object file for unresolved
symbols before any library. The statement, the the GNU linker is a one pass
linker makes sense only for libraries, because they are checked only once
for unresolved references. That means, if you include libraries in your
project you must know about the order, where this library is put on
the command line when linking your program.

<p>If you have problems with that order, or if you really want to have one
object file (or library) before some others, you must rename them, to
get the right position from the name.

This works only if the selected item has a known suffix
see <a href="#Known%20suffixes">Known suffixes</a>. If the selected item is
a project file, that project will be opened with the side effect that
if you close this project, the previous one will be reopened.

<p>If you have compiled a file already in RHIDE, you bring up a list with all
dependencies of that file. In this list the files are show by their
basename followed by the directory and they are also sorted in alphabetical
order. From here you can also open an editor window with the selected
dependency by pressing &lt;SPACE&gt; or &lt;ENTER&gt;

<br>

<h5>Error program</h5>

<p>If you have selected above the User error checking,
type here the program, which should check for errors and/or warnings. 
What the external error checking program should do:

<ul>
<li>The program must take a filename as argument, which contain the
output to stderr from the compiler (Error and warning messages)

<li>The program has to write to stdout the Warnings, Errors or
messages in a special format.

<dl>
<dt><code>Errors</code>
<dd>A line that starts with the string "!Error" (without the
double quotes) optionally followed by "!File" and a filename
in single quotes and "!Line" followed by a space and a line number
and "!Column" followed by a space and a coloumn number.

<p>If "!Line" and/or "!Column" are not used they dafault to 0. 
The next line contain the error text. 
Example:

<br><pre>
!Error!File'test.c'!Line 17
This is a sample error message

</pre>

<p>This means, that in file 'test.c' at line 17 an error occurred
with the description 'This is a sample error message'

<br><dt><code>Warnings</code>
<dd>Warnings have the same format, except that !Error is replaced by
!Warning.

<br><dt><code>Any other line</code>
<dd>is treated as a simple message optionally preceeded
by !File and !Line.

<p>WARNING: THE LIST OF VARIABLES AND STRINGFUNCTIONS DESCRIBED BELOW
MIGHT NOT BE UPTODATE. IF YOU WANT TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT ALL
FEATURES PLEASE LOOK IN THE SOURCES FOR RHIDE.

<p>RHIDE uses for compiling, linking, and the other stages of generating
a file also specs, like you can change in the local options for a
project item see <a href="#Local%20options">Local options</a>. Here the specs, which are used
currently:

<dl>
<dt>$(RHIDE_COMPILE_C)

<h3>4.6 Builtin variables</h3>

<p>This section describes, which variables can be used within RHIDE to get
values from some of the configurations, which you have made inside RHIDE.

<p>All of these variables are referenced by a name enclosed in parentheses
preceeded by a dollar sign. Example: <code>$(RHIDE_GCC)</code>. You can overwrite any
of the following variables, if you define in your environment the same
variable with any contents you want.

<p>When RHIDE tries to get the contents of such a variable, it searches at first
if it is found in it's internal database. If it was not found, the environment
is checked for such a variable and if that fails, the resulting value is
the variable itself.

<p>In addition to the use of variables, RHIDE has a limited ability of
using string manipulating functions. I have implemented some of the
functions, which are available with GNU make. They have the same name
and should work exactly like the GNU make counterpart.

<dl>
<dt><code>$(strip arg)</code>
<dd>This function removes any leading and trailing whitespace and converts
all multispaces to single spaces from the (whitespace separated list)
<code>arg</code>.

<br><dt><code>$(addsuffix arg1,arg2)</code>
<dd>These functions append on each argument from the whitespace separated list
<code>arg2</code> the string <code>arg1</code>.

<br><dt><code>$(addprefix arg1,arg2)</code>
<dd>This is the same as
<code>$(addsuffix arg1,arg2)</code>,
except that it puts
the string <code>arg1</code> before each argument from <code>arg2</code>.

<br><dt><code>$(notdir arg)</code>
<dd>This removes any directory part from the argument <code>arg</code>.

<br><dt><code>$(dir)</code>
<dd>This extracts only the directory part from the argument <code>arg</code>. If there
was no directory in <code>arg</code>, an empty string is returned. (The directory
contains also the drive letter, if there was one)

<br><dt><code>$(subst arg1,arg2,arg3)</code>
<dd>This replaces every occurrence of <code>arg1</code> in <code>arg3</code> with
<code>arg2</code>
</dl>

<p>The following variables have a special meaning in RHIDE with the default
contents:

<h3>4.7 Change the defaults of RHIDE</h3>

<p>If you have special wishes for compiling your source files, you can
configure for RHIDE mostly everything. For adding support for other
than the builtin known file types see <a href="#Builtin%20variables">Builtin variables</a>. If you
want to change the behavior of RHIDE for compiling all the known
file types you should know at first really what you do. If you think,
this is a good idea or if you only want only check if it works you can
do it.

<p>Before RHIDE compiles any file (this includes also linking and building
a library) it searches the environment for a variable after the following
scheme: When compiling a file with suffix <code>.c</code> to a file with
suffix <code>.o</code> RHIDE checks for the variable $(RHIDE_COMPILE.c.o). If
this variable is defined the contents of this variable is taken as the
compile spec.

<p>If you want to change the specs for linking you must take as destination
suffix <code>.exe</code> or <code>.</code> and as source suffix the suffix of
your object files. Example:

<br><pre>$(RHIDE_COMPILE.o.)
</pre>

<h3>4.8 Message window</h3>

<p>This window shows every time you compile a file the resulting messages, which
GCC produces. These messages were converted in a special format to show
them in the window. Some of the messages contain a file eventually combined
with a line number. If you press &lt;ENTER&gt;
on such
a message, the corresponding source line in the file will be highlighted
and the window with this file will be selected. If this file is not already
on the desktop, it will be opened.

<p>If the file, to which the messages refer, is already in the foreground you can
see the selected source line for your messages directly on the screen.

<h3>4.9 Syntax highlighting</h3>

<p>Syntax highlighting is now supported directly by the editor. It should
work in mostly every situation for all the supported types. Currently
(in RHIDE) only the C/C++ style syntax highlight and the Pascal style
syntax highlight are supported.

<p>With which style a file is highlighted is chosen by RHIDE by checking
the suffix of the file and determining the file type from that suffix
See <a href="#Known%20suffixes">Known suffixes</a>.

<h3>4.10 Checking the dependencies</h3>

<p>This is one of the main parts of RHIDE. To speed up the work, I have added
a cache for checking the modification time of a file and for finding
a file (computing the full name of a file). But sometimes the data in
the cache isn't valid, especially when running under Windows. If you see
this, you can clear the cache by leaving RHIDE and starting again.

<p>If you didn't do any special things but have problems with it, please
run RHIDE with the <code>-df</code> switch and try to find out, where the
problem is and post it to me so I can fix it.

<h3>4.11 What is Turbo Vision</h3>

<p>The Turbo Vision library is part of Turbo C++ version 3.1. I have ported
this library to use with DJGPP because I think it is the most powerful
text windowing library, which is available for MS-DOS. With the help of
this library you can write a front end application which looks very well
and has an interface that is easy to use.

<p>The Turbo Vision library is not only a window based text user interface,
it is also a very good event handling mechanism. It supports the use of
the mouse and keyboard with the ability of defining and using of hotkeys. 
That means, you can assign to some key or combinations of keys, which
function should be executed.

<p>The main parts of an application, which is using this library, are the
desktop, the menu bar and the status line. The menu bar is usually shown
as the topmost line of the screen. There are shown the main parts of
the pull down menus, from where you can select the most functions, which
are implemented in an application.

<p>To use the menu you can use the mouse as well the keyboard. With the mouse
you can click every where on a menu entry and the corresponding function
will be executed. There are some different actions, which a menu entry can
have. At first some of them, these are, for example, all the entries in the
menu bar, open a submenu with more menu entries which are related to
the name of this main entry. And the others, most in such a submenu, execute
a definite function of the application.

<p>With the keyboard you can walk through the menu very simply. Press
&lt;F10&gt;
to activate the menu bar. In the pull down
menus you can use the cursor keys to move the highlighted bar up and down
and with the cursor right and left keys you can switch to next or previous
menu. With the &lt;ENTER&gt;
key you activate the function,
which corresponds to this entry. If this was a submenu, which is indicated
with a symbol like a small right arrow, this will be opened.

<p>If you walk through the menu with the cursor keys or the mouse (hold the left
mouse button down and move the mouse) in the status line will be shown for
each entry a short hint for the function of this menu entry.

<h3>4.12 How the dialogs work</h3>

<p>In a dialog, like the file open dialog, are many things which you can select
or where you can type in some data. At first some general functions. If you
press &lt;ESC&gt;
the dialog will be closed and nothing will
be changed. The same can be done with the mouse by clicking on the close
symbol (this is the small symbol on upper left frame of the dialog).

<p>In the next paragraphs I will describe the most used elements of a dialog. 
For selecting each element of a dialog you can use the &lt;Tab&gt; key to
select the next element in the dialog or the <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd> key, to select
the previous element.

<p>A button is a rectangle with some text on it. If you activate such a button a
specified action is executed. To select a button you can use the &lt;Tab&gt;
key, until the button is specially highlighted and press
&lt;ENTER&gt;
then. Most times a character of the text on this
button has a different color. So you can press &lt;Alt&gt; plus this character to
activate the button. With the mouse you can simply click on a button to
activate it.

<p>A Listbox is a collection of some strings in one or more columns and rows as
needed. The project window see <a href="#Project%20window">Project window</a> is such a Listbox with
the names of the project items. You can use the cursor keys to move the
focus bar in the list, or if it is a sorted Listbox, you can also type
some characters and the focus will move to the item, which starts with
these characters. To select a item in a list box, press &lt;SPACE&gt; or
&lt;ENTER&gt;
or double click with mouse on it.

<p>In an input line you can type some text which can be edited with the usual
editing keys.

<p>A checkbox is a collection of options, which can be turned on or off. 
Each option has in front of it a small indicator, if it is turned on
(an X is shown) or not (the X is not shown). To toggle such an option,
use the cursor keys to move the focus to the option you want and press
&lt;SPACE&gt;
or, if a character in an option string is
highlighted you can press this key and the option will be turned on or
off or click with the mouse on the option.

<p>Radiobuttons are similar to Checkboxes, but there you can select only
one of all the shown options.

<h3>4.14 The INFO Viewer</h3>

<p>The integrated help system of RHIDE is based on the INFO
Viewer written by <a href="mailto:Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET)">salvador@inti.gov.ar</a>. It gives you access to all the INFO
files which you have installed in the correct directories as is done
for <code>info.exe</code>.

<p>To get help about the INFO Viewer hit &lt;F1&gt;
when
the help-window is opened or follow this link to
<a href="infview.html#Top">Top</a>.

<p>In addition to getting help with this system you can also copy text
from the help screen to the clipboard. This is useful if you want
for instance to copy an example from the libc reference in your
program. This feature is not so powerful as in the editor, but
it is good enough. To mark some text use the &lt;Shift&gt; and
cursor keys and copy the selected text with <kbd>Ctrl+Ins</kbd> to
the clipboard.

<p>In RHIDE you have also the possibility to get help about a specific
function. Currently this works only for functions, which are documented
in the libc reference. For doing this, move the cursor to the function
and hit &lt;Ctrl+F1&gt;
or click with the right button of
the mouse on that word.

<h3>4.15 RCS and RHIDE</h3>

<p>RHIDE knows a little bit about RCS, the Revision Control System. Since
RCS is available also for DJGPP I enabled now some features to use
RHIDE also on packages which use RCS.

<p>RHIDE can handle RCS files in the way, that it searches for a checked
in source file if the normal source file was not found. The complicatest
part here was to determin the correct RCS file name from the source
name. (Especially under DJGPP this is a problem since under raw DOS
it is not possible to use names like 'foo.c,v').

<p>So I decided to use the external program <code>rlog</code> which comes with
the RCS package to determine the actual correct RCS source name. I did
so because the DJGPP implementation knows enough about the DOS
limitation and how to solve them.

<p>This help here is not ment to be a RCS introduction. If you don't know
what RCS is or what can be done with it, please look in the
manuals wich come with RCS.

<p>Here now what RHIDE knows about the RCS files. If a source file was
not found, it's RCS name is computed with the spec <code>$(RHIDE_RLOG)</code>
which defaults to <code>$(shell rlog -R $(rlog_arg))</code> where <code>$(rlog_arg)</code>
is substituted at runtime with the actual wanted source file.

<p>This spec can be overwritten to speed it up. An example for this can
be found in the distributed sample environment file <code>rhide_.env</code>.

<p>When RHIDE only wants to compile the file or only to get the modification
time it is temporary checked out (without locking it) and after the
needed operation (compiling) it is removed (for checking the modification
time it is not checked out, but the time form the RCS file is taken).

<p>If you want to open that file for editing the same is done but now it is
checked out with setting a lock and it is not checked in after closing
the window. The spec for checking the file out is <code>$(RHIDE_CO)</code>
which can be overwritten also and it defaults to
<code>$(shell co -q $(co_arg))</code> where the switch <code>-l</code> is added
when it is checked out for edititing otherwise <code>$(co_arg)</code> is
substituted at runtime only with the wanted source file.

<h2>5 Debugging with RHIDE</h2>

<p>For debugging your programs you need now no external debugger, because
RHIDE has one integrated. The integrated debugger is not code which
I have written, but it is GDB 4.16, which is linked in RHIDE.

<p>Because RHIDE uses a special method to communicate with GDB it is currently
not possible to use all of the features, which GDB has. I have implemented
at this time the most important functions, which are needed to debug your
program. So it is not possible to give GDB the same commands as when
running GDB stand alone. That means, if you need any very special feature
of GDB you must run GDB.

<p>The integrated debugger is a real source level debugger like GDB. If
you step through your program you will see every time exactly where
in the sources you are. But to use the ability to debug your
program needs, that you have compiled your source files with
debugging information and these symbols must not have been stripped
from the executable.

<h3>5.1 Limitations of the integrated debugger</h3>

<p>Because the integrated debugger is GDB, you will have all the limitations
which GDB has in addition to well known DJGPP and/or MS-DOS limitations. 
Here is a (not complete) list of known misfeatures:

<ul>
<li>Signals are not correctly handled every time by distinguishing between
the debuggee and RHIDE

<li>Remote debugging is NOT supported

<li>Debugging of graphic programs may work or not depending on
the software you are using. Currently only the VESA modes and the
standard VGA graphic modes are supported.

<li>When using the integrated debugger under
Windows 3.1x (in Windows 95 there is no such limitation) the number
of breakpoints is limited to 3, because you can use there only hardware
breakpoints. The i386 supports only 4 hardware breakpoints and 1 is needed
for internal use. 
This is a
common problem for all DJGPP debuggers. (Try to use FSDB with more than
3 breakpoints under Windows 3.1x)

<li>Sometimes the source line, which is shown by RHIDE in assuming
that the execution is there, is not correct. But this is NOT a bug of
RHIDE and NOT of GDB. This is a bug in GCC which produces wrong line
number information in the object files. Here is a very simple test
program, with which you can see this problem.

<br><pre>/* This is an example, that GCC produces wrong line number
   information for code which is optimized out. (compile this
   with -O) */

int a = 1;
int b = 2;

int main()
{
  if (a == b) return 0;
  if ((a + 1) == b) return 1;
  return 0; /* The debugger should never come here,
               but it comes */
}
</pre>

</ul>

<h3>5.2 Dual display debugging</h3>

<p>RHIDE supports now also to use an installed dual display. This is when
you have installed in addition to your VGA card a monochrome display
card together with a monitor. RHIDE checks this by asking the BIOS
if it is present and if this is true and the option is enabled
see <a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> then RHIDE switches automatically to
the secondary display when debugging and your program will run
on the primary display.

<p>With this debugging technique you will get the best debugging results
especially when debugging graphics programs.

<p>To use the dual display with RHGDB use the <code>-D</code> switch for
RHGDB.

<h4>5.3.1 Stepping through the source code</h4>

<p>For stepping through your code, there are three ways. This is at first
the Step-function &lt;F8&gt;. With this you execute a complete source
line. If there is a function call at the current execution point, this
function is called without debugging it. This technique is the same
like the <code>next</code>-command from GDB.

<p>The next way is the Trace-function. 
It is like the Step-function, &lt;F7&gt;, except that if there is a function
call at the current execution point, you will go into this function when
there is debugging information for that function available. 
This technique is the same as the <code>step</code>-command from GDB.

<p>And the third way is the Goto-Cursor-function. For this, move the cursor
to the line in your source code and press &lt;F4&gt;. Now the execution of
your program is continued until it comes to that line. Sometimes you will
get an error message, that for the specified line is no code generated. 
This comes from the optimization of your code by GCC. In this case try
a line below or above.

<br>

<h4>5.3.2 Evaluating the contents of variables</h4>

<p>You can evaluate also the the contents of variables, when your program
has been started. For this you can press <kbd>Ctrl+F4</kbd> and you will
see a dialog, where you can type in the expression to evaluate, a line
with the result and a line, where you can give the expression a new
value. If you have pressed this in an editor window, RHIDE tries to find
the word under the cursor and copies this as default in the
expression input line. To get the contents of this expression you have
to press the <em>Evaluate</em>-button.

<p>If the expression could not be evaluated so it is shown in the result line. 
For the exact syntax of getting the contents of an expression
see <a href="gdb.html#Expressions">Expressions</a>. You can also show the value of the
expression in several formats see <a href="gdb.html#Output%20Formats">Output Formats</a>.

<p>In addition to the functionality of the Borland debuggers, GDB (and
of course also RHIDE) can evaluate the result of function calls. If
you have, for example, in your debugged program a function
<br><pre>int foo(int arg1)
{
/* do something and return a value */
}
</pre>
defined, you can type in the expression input line
<br><pre>foo(16)
</pre>
and you will get as result, what the function would return, if it is
called with the argument <code>16</code>. As arguments you can also use
any known variable or complex expressions.

<p>A known limitation is, that the expressions are NOT checked for validity. 
That means, you can produce any exception there, which will terminate
your program. As an example type in the expression input line
<br><pre>3/0
</pre>
And, of course, you cannot assign to a function call a new value.

<p>As an special side effect you can use this also as a calculator. You
can evaluate any trivial or complex expression and this is also available,
if you haven't started the integrated debugger.

<h4>5.3.3 Watching the contents of variables</h4>

<p>In addition to a single look at the contents of a variable, you can
add the variable to a list which is updated after each debugger
step and is shown in the watching window. For this function you
can use the hotkey <kbd>Ctrl+F7</kbd>.

<p>Within the watch window you can press &lt;Enter&gt; on an expression
to change that expression (NOT the contents of that expression)
or you can press &lt;Del&gt;
to remove the variable
from the watch window.

<h3>5.4 Problems with C++ programs</h3>

<p>Because GDB cannot handle correctly C++ debugging information
when it is generated as COFF debugging information (with stabs
debugging information there is no such limitation and you can
skip reading more) you will
have many problems when debugging C++ programs to get the contents
of a variable when it is a member of a class. Because GDB does not
detect, that your program is a C++ program, it sees it as a normal
C program and so GDB does nothing know about classes and all what
have to do with it.

<p>For accessing the member of a baseclass you must do some tricks. Let me explain
it on an example:

<br><pre>class A
{
public:
  int a;
};

class B : public A
{
public:
  void test();
};

void B::test()
{
  fprintf(stdout,"%d\n",a);
}

</pre>

<p>If you debug the program in the function <code>B::test()</code> and you
want to get the contents of the member <code>a</code>, you have to access
it with <code>this-&gt;A.a</code> !!! That means: At first you must access
all members with the implicit <code>this</code> variable and at second
you must give all baseclasses until that, where the member was
declared.

<h3>5.5 Using Breakpoints</h3>

<p>Breakpoints are a very useful thing when debugging a program. You
can set a breakpoint at any location of your program and run it. It
will be automatically stopped, if the program execution reaches the
breakpoint.

<h4>5.5.1 Setting a breakpoint</h4>

<p>For setting a breakpoint there are two different ways. The first is
by setting a breakpoint at any line by pressing
<kbd>Ctrl+F8</kbd>. You will see, that there is a
breakpoint set, that this line is shown in another color. If
you hit <kbd>Ctrl+F8</kbd> on a line, which
has already a breakpoint, the breakpoint at this line
is removed.

Up:<a rel=up accesskey=u href="#Using%20Breakpoints">Using Breakpoints</a>
<br>

<h4>5.5.2 Modifying and setting a breakpoint</h4>

<p>The second way is by setting a breakpoint with the breakpoint dialog
which is selectable only from the menu. There you will see any breakpoint
for your program. These breakpoints can be modified now in many things. 
In this dialog you can enable/disable a breakpoint. This is not the
same as deleting and resetting it. If you disable a breakpoint, it is
stored internally but it is not used. If you enable it again all the settings
for that breakpoint, which you have already made, are remembered.

<p>In the breakpoint dialog you can also set or delete a breakpoint with
the given buttons. If you want to set a new breakpoint, use the
New-Button. Then you will get a dialog which you also get when you
press the Modify-Button. In this dialog you can change many things of
the breakpoint.

<p>In this dialog is the only point for setting a breakpoint at a
specified function. For doing this you must set at first the type
of the breakpoint to Function. Then you can type in the function input line
the name of the function or hit &lt;Ctrl+F1&gt;
to
get a list of functions which are available from where you can select
one with &lt;Enter&gt;.

<p>For setting a breakpoint at a specified line, set the breakpoint type
to Line and type in the filename and the linenumber.

<p>The next what you can modify on a breakpoint is a condition. That means
that the breakpoint should stop your program only, if the condition
is true. Write the condition in the programming language of your
source file and you can use any accessible variable and you can call
also functions of the debugged program. For other information about the
syntax see <a href="gdb.html#Conditions">Conditions</a>.

<p>And at last you can give your breakpoints also a count. A breakpoint count
is a number, how often this breakpoint is ignored. That means, if you type
there, for example, <kbd>10</kbd>, then the RHIDE stops the execution of the program
only, if it comes to that point the tenth time. WARNING: This count is
set by RHIDE only once. After the breakpoint is really hit, from now on
the breakpoint stops your program every time, the breakpoint is reached.

<br>

<h4>5.5.3 Problems with breakpoints</h4>

<p>Currently there is a big problem, when you have set a breakpoint at a
line (not at a function) of your program and you edit now the source
code. If you insert or delete some lines the breakpoints, which are
set at lines after or at the modified lines are NOT updated to the correct
line number.

<h2>6 Debugging with RHGDB</h2>

<p>In addition to RHIDE, which has an integrated debugger, there is also
a stand-alone debugger called RHGDB. (The name comes from my initials
and GDB)

<p>RHGDB has the same abilities as RHIDE for debugging your program. But
it has no editor. The source files are shown in read only windows where
you can move the cursor and other things (except editing) like in RHIDE.

<p>The menu tree is analog of RHIDE's but (of course) it has not all the menu
entries of RHIDE, because RHGDB should be used only for debugging and
nothing else.

<p>I have written it to debug DJGPP programs, for which there is no
RHIDE project file available but the program has debugging information
and, if you are short of memory, it is much smaller than RHIDE.

<p>The syntax for using RHGDB is very simple. Run it with your program
as the first argument followed by any argument, which should be passed
to your program.

<p>RHGDB saves and reads the options from files with the suffix <code>.rgd</code>. 
This is done automatically when you run RHGDB with your program as argument
by searching a file with the same basename of your program and the suffix
<code>.rgd</code> and in this file the options are also automatically stored,
when you exit RHGDB.

<p>Alternatively you can also save/read the options from within RHIDE
by selecting the corresponding menu entries from the Options menu.

<p>To use the the "Dual display debugging" feature of RHGDB you must
give on commandline the <code>-D</code> switch.

<h2>7 Some FAQs</h2>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have enabled the <code>Use tabs</code> option, but if I move
the cursor through that tab, it seems, that RHIDE uses spaces</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:This behavior cannot (currently) be changed. Even when you
have enabled the use of real tabs (characters with the code 9), the
cursor is moved as if there are spaces.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: Are there any sample project files, to show how RHIDE works?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:The sources of RHIDE include many project files to rebuild
at least RHIDE with itself and many others.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have written some libraries. How can I use them in a project?</em>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: How I can use a library, which I have?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: There are some different ways to do this. On the one side you can
include them directly in the project with the
<em>Add to project item</em> function see <a href="#Add%20item">Add item</a>. But if they are
not in the current directory, you must also set the library search path
to the directory, where they are see <a href="#Library%20directories">Library directories</a>. The other
variant is to include them in the list of libraries see <a href="#Libraries">Libraries</a>.

<p>If this library is created with RHIDE, that means you have a project
file for building this library you can also simply include that
project file in your project. For examples, look at the RHIDE sources
in the project file for RHIDE.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have a directory, where all my include files are. Can I setup
RHIDE to have this directory every time in the include search path, when
creating a new project?</em>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I prefer the 80x28 video mode over the default 80x25 mode. How I
can turn this mode on by default for all newly created project files?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: You can create a default project file. From this file RHIDE reads
all the options, if it creates a new project. The default project must
have the same basename as the executable of RHIDE and must be located in
the same directory.

<p>The creation of such a default project file is very simple. Change to the
directory, where <code>rhide.exe</code> is located and run there
<br><pre>rhide rhide
</pre>

<p>Now make any changes in the options which you want to have as default for
all newly created projects. This includes also settings in the various
search paths. If you are ready, exit RHIDE and this project file will
be your default project file.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I know, that I can create a default project file. Can I create and use
more than one?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:Since DJGPP supports a quasi-Unix-like link for executables, you can
create such a link also for RHIDE. As an example I will create a link to
<code>rhide.exe</code> with the name <code>myrhide.exe</code>. At first I have to
create the new file.
<br><pre>stubify -g myrhide.exe
</pre>
Now I must tell <code>myrhide.exe</code> which program it really should run.
<br><pre>stubedit myrhide.exe runfile=rhide
</pre>
Thats all. Or, if you have installed the GNU fileutils, you can use also
now the <code>ln.exe</code> program to create the link:
<br><pre>ln -s rhide.exe myrhide.exe
</pre>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I don't want to type every time I start RHIDE
the commandline <var>-L de</var>
to use the German user interface. Is there any better way?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Create an environment variable <var>LANGUAGE</var> with your preferred
language like
<br><pre>set LANGUAGE=de
</pre>
and your problem is solved.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have 4 Mb RAM in my computer and every time, when I compile large
files with optimizations enabled, my hard disk is working very hard.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:Buy more RAM!

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I heard something about a newer version RHIDE. From where I can get
exact information about this?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: See
<br>
<a href="http://www.rhide.com">at the RHIDE home page</a>. 
<br>
This page contains the latest news and the latest version of RHIDE.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have a lot of money and don't know what to do with it. Can you
help me?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Send it to me, so I can spend more time for developing
RHIDE. My Address is:
<br><pre>Robert Hoehne
Am Berg 3
D-09573 Dittmannsdorf
Germany
</pre>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: RHIDE does all sorts of unpredictable and silly things.  I.e. does not
remember the paths and other settings that I give it.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Did you start RHIDE with a project file i.e. invoke rhide with
<br><pre>rhide projfile
</pre>
RHIDE needs a place to keep this information.   Then go into
projects tab and select add then follow the dialog to add the  <code>.c</code> or
<code>.cc</code>  file to the project.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I do not generate an <code>.exe</code> file.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Enter RHIDE from the dos prompt by
<br><pre>rhide projname
</pre>
click project tab
then add and select your <code>Hello.c</code> or <code>hello.cc</code> file. 
Then compile and
then link or else build all.  There should be a file <code>projname.exe</code>.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: The linker reports multiple <code>int main()</code> in my object file.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: You have more than one <code>.c</code> or <code>.cc</code> file in your project with
<code>int main()</code>
and the linker does not know where to start the <code>.exe</code> file.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: It is not finding the include files <code>*.h</code>.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: You are not referring to the djgpp distribution <code>*.h</code> files that
are part of the DJGPP standard distribution.  If so see DJGPP FAQ.  In RHIDE
click the Options tab on top of RHIDE window, then Directories, then
Include, then add the path to the <code>dot.h</code> files in the text box as
follows:
<br><pre>$(DJDIR)/contrib/grx/include $(DJDIR)/contrib/here/there etc
</pre>
This path can also be set in the <code>djgpp.env</code> file (see the DJGPP
information).

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: It's still not finding the <code>dot.h</code> files.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Invoke Win95 long file names at the command line via
<br><pre>rhide -y projname
</pre>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: How do I set rhide to long file names without -y each time?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Add the <var>-y</var> to your <var>RHIDEOPT</var> environment variable.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: The linker is not finding various library functions that are in an
extension to DJGPP.  For example functions that are part of SWORD
Graphic User Interface or GRX. Graphic Package.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Click the Options tab then Libraries then mark one of the boxes and
type in the Library name that you need i.e. <var>grx</var> for <code>libgrx.a</code>.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: It's still not finding the library functions.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Go into Options tab on top of the RHIDE window then Directories then
Libraries, then add the path to the <code>libdot.a</code> files in the text box as
follows:
<br><pre>$(DJDIR)/contrib/lib/here/there $(DJDIR)/contrib/grx/lib
</pre>
This can also be set in the <code>djgpp.env</code> file (see the DJGPP information).

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: Where is the rhide documentation and how do I read it?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:Get the file txixxxb.zip and unzip it.  Go into dir info and edit the file DIR.  Add
<code>rhide.inf</code> or any other <code>dot.inf</code> to DIR.  Use the same format as the
existing <code>dot.inf</code> files in DIR. It's obvious from the format how to do
this.  Save and exit from the edit session.  Type "info" take the lesson
on how to run info and you are fully equipped to run an old world non
gui browser and are ready to learn all about gnu.

<p>If you are using RHIDE, simply hit &lt;F1&gt; and browse through the
help, it IS the RHIDE documentation!

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: The linker reports out of memory when linking many <code>*.o</code> files.</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: This should occour only on Windows 95 users (or W98). 
Give dos more memory. Quit rhide and dos.  Select the dos icon or its
alias (it's in <code>windows/start/programs</code>) RIGHT click select properties
then select memory tab then set Protected mode DPMI to maximum 65535 and have
another go.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I have a big svga monitor and rhide looks like cga screen.  What can I
do to take advantage of my monitor?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:Set the dos and rhide screens to suite your taste. 
Quit rhide and dos.  Select the dos icon or its alias (it's in
<code>windows/start/programs</code>) RIGHT click select properties then select screen
tab then set the type of screen that you require in dos.  Then get into
RHIDE and select options tab on the top of the screen then Environment
and then Preferences then set the type of screen to your liking.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I`m running under W95/98 with long filenames and have some
source files ond/or directory names with spaces in it. I get many
errors when trying to compile or link. How can I solve this?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: This is a limitation of RHIDE. Theortically it could be
fixed, but this would need many changes in the RHIDE sources. I`m
not willing to do. So, simply do not not filenames with spaces.

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: How do I setup RHIDE to run under OS/2?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>: OS/2 (WARP3 and above) Users have to pay attention to the following
DOS-Settings:
<br><pre>- DPMI_DOS_API must be set to "Enabled"
- DPMI_MEMORY_LIMIT should be set above 8MB (better &gt;10)
- DOS_HIGH must be set to OFF
- DOS_UMB must be set to OFF
- DOS_FILES should be set fairly higher than 20 (&gt;60)
- DOS_BREAK "ON" might be useful sometimes :-)
- MOUSE_EXCLUSIVE_ACCESS should be set to off
- You can use RHIDE with or without the "-M" option
</pre>

<p><em><strong>Question</strong>: I think, I found a bug in RHIDE. How can I report it?</em>

<p><strong>Answer</strong>:At first try for your own to solve the problem by checking the
documentation.

<p>If the bug is releated to the editor (some keys do not work,
autoindenting is not like you expect, program crash after some
special editing ...) please send them to <a href="mailto:Salvador Eduardo Tropea (SET)">salvador@inti.gov.ar</a>, because he
is the author of the in RHIDE integrated editor.

<p>See at
<a href="http://www.rhide.com">the RHIDE home page</a>,
if this problem was already reported by other
users. As the next ask the problem in the news group
<a href="news:comp.os.msdos.djgpp">news:comp.os.msdos.djgpp</a>, because there may be some other people
with the same problem, and they can give you an answer or I, because
I read this group also.

<p>GNU/Linux users should post the problems in the linux group. To make sure
that I will read it also, please send a CC to me because my time
doesn`t allow me to read that huge newsgroups.

<p>If this don't help you, do the following:

<blockquote>
Try to reproduce the error with the smallest possible project or
source file. Run RHIDE with all debugging options enabled and redirect
the printed output to a file see <a href="#Debugging%20RHIDE">Debugging RHIDE</a>. Send me this file
and a detailed as possible description of the problem and include in
your report the exact version of RHIDE you are using.

<p>The exact version is shown in the About-Dialog and means the version
number together with the build date.

</blockquote>

<p>And a last note. If I get bug reports or questions or problems with
RHIDE which I think that they are of common interest be warned that
I bounce them simply to the news groups because at this time it is
impossible for me to answer all the mails I get. So the best is to
post the questions and/or problems only in the news groups.
